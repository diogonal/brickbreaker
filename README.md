Mobile Computing Game: BrickBreaker

https://github.com/jzaldumbide/mobilecomputing.git

### Description:
BrickBreaker is a breakout Android game developed with libgdx (openGL 2.0). 
Once installed and when the player starts the game you'll have to enter your name, the game detects if is the first time you are playing, 
so you only have to enter your name once. That's the way the game can know who you are in order to submit your scores and update your rank. 
The game will show you a splash screen while the levels are downloaded from a server in a background process (from a cloud or local server).
If something goes wrong, the game will let you know through error and info messages, however you'll be able to play with default configurations and
levels. Else, you are ready to play the downloaded levels!
You can go through the game options and menus where you can enable/disable sound, music or decide if you want to control your paddle with accelerometer 
or just touch. If you need help about some option of the game you can enter to the help menu. 
If you select Scores you will see a top 10 list of current ranked players, this list gets updated always. Check what is the player you want to beat and
start the game by touching the Play! menu. Then the game will let you select the level you want to play, if is the first time you only will have the level
1 enabled, the rest of them will open when you win each level. Then you can start playing the game. Each level has different configuration and difficulty which 
are defined in the XML files, if you want to make your own, just edit some of them and have fun! While you are playing, the game will give you free bonuses, some of
them give you extra points and other make you lose. Scores and Rankings are updated while you're playing you can check yours at the top of the screen.
